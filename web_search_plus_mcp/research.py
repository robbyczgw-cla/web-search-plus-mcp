    Research mode is intentionally best-effort: provider/extraction failures should
    produce diagnostics and partial search results instead of throwing away the
    whole response. Provider searches run concurrently to keep the wall-clock cost
    close to the slowest single provider rather than the sum of all of them. The
    optional time budget gates which providers are launched (checked before each
    submission, so a tight budget still skips later providers deterministically),
    bounds how long already-launched providers may run, and gates whether
    extraction runs at all — so the budget caps total wall-clock time instead of
    only limiting how many providers start.

    Result ordering is preserved by provider submission order regardless of which
    provider finishes first, so deduplication stays deterministic.
