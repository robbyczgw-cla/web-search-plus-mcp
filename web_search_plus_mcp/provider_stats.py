"""Rolling provider performance memory for adaptive routing.

Routing v2 scores are benchmarked but static: a provider that has been slow
or returning empty results for days keeps its full score. This module records
the real outcome of every provider call (latency, result count, errors) in a
small rolling window and turns it into a bounded score adjustment, so routing
gently prefers providers that are currently fast and productive — without
ever overriding strong query-class signals.
